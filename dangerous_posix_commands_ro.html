The command 'rm' is dangerous and its recursive force version is even more so.
An alternative is to use the trash-cli package that copies files to a trashcan
folder. That way complete deletion happens in two steps and mistakes might be
caught. If trash-cli is not available for your system you might simply use a
shell script to copy files and folders to a dedicated trash folder with a shell
script.

TODO find a shell script replacement for trash-cli

TODO set -o noclobber for > shell redirect to file

package trash-cli is available in many Linux distributions as a replacement
for the 'rm' command that copies the files meant for deleation to a special
folder called trashcan. It's behaviour is like that of copying the folder<br>

    this should be the way to access user's command
    when running nushell preexec hooks
    use this to start parsing user input
    and deny access to dangerous commands
'mv -i' 'cp -i' 'rm -i'
