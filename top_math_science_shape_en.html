        <b>
The main idea
        </b>
        </br>

Two main abilities are necessary to succeed:
work ethics and creativity.
Work ethics means going over the content you want to learn
a minimum number of hours each day no matter how well
you think you already know it.
To succeed you also need to have creativity:
search for problems you have never seen before
and attempt to solve them without looking at ready made
solutions that have been handed to you.
    </br></br>

    <b>
My past experience
    </b>
    </br>

Every time I didn't have work ethics and I ignored the need
for creativity in the learning process I suffered setbacks.

A wise youtube playlist regarding studying in college
    </b>
    </br>

The following link is to a youtube playlist of videos where a college
professor explains what I found to be the best way to study a book or
a course which is to use summarisation and avoid the scam that is
speed reading:
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7YPshZMeLIa2KksLNqmWx_SANbSjaUbU"
    >youtube link
    </a>.
Summarise the paragraphs one by one and write down the summaries
to use them later when you go over the material to recall it.

    <b>
A mathematics present accesible to everyone
    </b>
    </br>

The book that I am refering to is titled <u> Mathematics: A Very Short
Introduction </u> and is writen by the Fields Medal awarded Timothy Gowers.
The book brings toghether a variety of mathematical topics explained
in the simplest way that the author could think about that is accessible
to high school students. The presentation is meant to show how a research
mathemtatician thinks about mathematics and also show the historical
development of the subject to people that are laymen of mathematics.
